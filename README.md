### a quiet universe where people draw planets and leave them for others to find 🌌

You **draw a planet** on a little canvas, **name it**, and **launch it** — it sails
off, finds a star, and starts to orbit. Then it's just… *there*, quietly circling
its sun, for anyone who drifts by. 🪐

No feed. No likes. No profiles. **Just planets.**

## ✨ the loop

> 🔭 explore → 🎨 draw → 🌈 make it yours → ✍️ name → 🚀 launch → 🔎 discover

- 🎨 **draw** — one honest brush, a curated palette, an eraser. Your art wraps around the back of the sphere.
- 🌈 **make it yours** — pick a surface and a mood. Rings? Moons? *The universe decides.*
- 🚀 **launch** — your world glides out to orbit a real star; a quiet line whispers where it went.
- 🔎 **discover** — search by name (every one is unique) and travel there. Love it? Share its collectible card.
- 💌 **make it for someone** — paste a Spotify or YouTube link and leave one line. Every planet has its own address, `/p/<name>`; open it and you're flown straight there, the line appears, and their song plays (audio only) when you press play.

## 🌌 what makes it feel alive

- 🛰️ a **spacecraft-instrument HUD** over a living 3D sky — hairline strokes, condensed type, a whisper of amber
- 🌫️ **real depth** — a world-fixed dust field + distant nebulae that drift and resolve as you cross the void
- ☀️ planets **lit by their own suns** (true day/night terminators), cratered moons, banded rings
- 🎧 a **generative soundscape** that answers to nearby suns, dense regions, and the odd passing comet
- 📱 **built for phones too** — recomposed for touch, not shrunk from desktop

## 🕵️ anonymous by design

no accounts · no logins · no tracking · no cookies — just two quiet, fair rules:

- 🪐 **one planet per network per day** — a public IP can make one planet a day, enforced in the database via a one-way hash of the IP (the raw IP is never stored). it's per-*network*, not per-person, and tomorrow you can make another.
- 🚩 **community moderation** — a planet reported by **3 different networks** is hidden; reporter identities are one-way hashes, and a creator never learns who reported.

→ the full, plain-English story lives in [`PRIVACY.md`](PRIVACY.md).

## 💌 planets for someone

A planet can carry a **song** (a Spotify track or a YouTube video) and **one line** (80 characters).
Its address is `https://go-astray.vercel.app/p/<name>`; the link unfurls as a card, the planet as a
lit coin with its name, line and song (`api/og.js` renders a 1200x630 PNG with `@vercel/og`;
`api/p.js` injects the Open Graph tags into the built app for crawlers), and opening it flies the
visitor across the void to that planet, where the line appears with a play control.

- **audio only.** The provider's player exists for the sound and is never shown; the panel has its
  own play/pause and shows the song's title, which the server fetched once at creation through the
  providers' public oEmbed endpoints (`lib/song-meta.js`).
- **nothing loads until play.** No Spotify or YouTube byte reaches the visitor's browser until they
  press play on that planet; leaving the planet tears the player down.
- **only the bare id is stored** (`song_provider`, `song_id`, `song_start`, `song_title`), never the
  pasted URL or its tracking parameters. `lib/song.js` is the one parser, used by the browser for
  live validation and by the server as the only validation that counts.
- Spotify plays the full track only for visitors signed into Spotify in that browser, a 30-second
  preview for everyone else. YouTube plays the whole thing for anyone. The creator says so.
- Migration `005_gifts_and_daily_limit.sql` adds the columns and moves the creation limit to
  one per network per **day** (UTC), so a person can make a planet for a friend today and another
  for another friend tomorrow.
- **Sealed until a day.** The maker can pick a date; until local midnight of that day the public
  API returns the planet without its line, song and voice (`lib/reveal.js`, enforced on the
  server), and the arrival panel counts down and opens it live when the moment comes.
- **A voice line.** Up to ten seconds recorded in the browser (WebM/Opus, MP4/AAC on Safari),
  validated by magic bytes and capped at 400KB (`lib/validate-voice.js`), stored as a file next to
  the artwork. Played through a plain `<audio>` on tap; nothing loads before that.
- **Wallpaper.** Any planet exports as a 1080x1920 phone wallpaper, drawn in the browser from the
  artwork the renderer already holds (`src/wallpaper.js`). Migration `006_sealed_and_voice.sql`.

## 🚀 run it

```bash
npm install
npm run dev        # front end on :5173, proxies /api → :3000
npm run dev:api    # second terminal — a local stand-in for the /api functions (no Supabase needed)
# or: vercel dev    # the real functions, if you have a Supabase project configured
```

> ⚠️ `npm run dev` **alone** leaves `/api/*` unanswered — every call 500s and the universe boots empty. Run `npm run dev:api` (an in-memory universe persisted to `.dev-universe/`, git-ignored) or `vercel dev` alongside it.

```bash
npm test           # 67 tests · node --test
```

## 🛠️ under the hood

Vanilla **Three.js** + **Vite**, no framework. Persistence is a free **Supabase**
project (Postgres + Storage) behind **Vercel** serverless functions — the browser
only ever talks to `/api/*`, and the service-role key stays server-side. The whole
universe is **deterministic from one seed**, so space looks the same on every
visit; only your planets are dynamic. Stars fill by type (blue 4 · white 6 ·
orange 9 · yellow 12 · red 15) and when they're full the universe **mints a
brand-new star** to home your world — creation never gets blocked for space.
